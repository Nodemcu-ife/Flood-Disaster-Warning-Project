# Miniaturized Water Flow and Level Monitoring System for Flood Disaster Early Warning
This is my Final Year Project where I used the Float Switch and Water Flow Sensor to build a Flood Monitoring System.The system is made in such a way that water flows into a container where the inflow rate is measured first by water fow sensor and then the water level is measured afterwards.
